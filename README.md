# autohotkey_countdown
Simple window with a second counter

By default it places it self on a screen to the left of the main screen, you will need to adjust the POS_X and POS_Y values for your usecase.

## Starting and resetting
Start with XButton1 (mouse button 4 I belive), this creates a window if not already created and starts the countdown. If the mousebutton is
pressed again the countdown starts over.

## Hiding
You can hide the window by pressing XButton2 (mouse button 5 I belive).
